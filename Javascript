for  concatenation we can use + or comma operator
Absence of value is undefined for a variable.
to declare a constant we use const keyword

Naming convention:
Variable name should not match with keyword
variable name should start with alphabet,$,_ is permitted
variable name can contain number
varialbe name cannot have special characters except $,_
variable name is case sensitive

typeof: is used to identify the data type

Datatypes:
Primitive datatypes:
number
boolean
String


undefined
null
Array
Object
function,date,
Regular expressions


typecasting:
parseInt(String) --converts String datatype to Number datatype
if String is starting with number and contains alphabets it discards all the characters and display the number
"2"+"4a"-->24
"2a"+"4a"-->2
"a2"+"4"-->NaN
